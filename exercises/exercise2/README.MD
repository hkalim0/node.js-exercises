# Exercise 2: Using Console Logs

In this exercise, we'll explore different types of console logs commonly used in JavaScript.

## Basic Logging

The `console.log()` method is used to output a message to the console. It is the most commonly used method for logging.

Example:

console.log("This is a basic log message.");


## Info Logging

The `console.info()` method is used to output an informational message to the console.

Example:

console.info("This is an informational message.");


## Warning Logging

The `console.warn()` method is used to output a warning message to the console.

Example:

console.warn("This is a warning message.");


## Error Logging

The `console.error()` method is used to output an error message to the console.

Example:

console.error("This is an error message.");


## Debug Logging

The `console.debug()` method is used to output a debug message to the console. It is useful for debugging purposes and may not always be displayed by default in all environments.

Example:

console.debug("This is a debug message.");


## Grouping Logs

The `console.group()`, `console.groupCollapsed()`, and `console.groupEnd()` methods are used to group related log messages together in the console's log.

Example:

console.group("Grouping Example");
console.log("Message 1");
console.log("Message 2");
console.groupEnd();


## Counting Logs

The `console.count()` method is used to count the number of times that count() has been called with the given label.

Example:

console.count("Counter");
console.count("Counter");
console.count("Counter");


## Timing Logs

The `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` methods are used to measure the time it takes to execute a block of code.

Example:

console.time("Timer");
// Some code to measure
console.timeEnd("Timer");


## Table Logs

The `console.table()` method is used to output tabular data as a table.

Example:

const data = [
  { name: "John", age: 30 },
  { name: "Jane", age: 25 }
];
console.table(data);


## Clearing Logs

The `console.clear()` method is used to clear the console.

Example:

console.clear();


## Asserting Logs

The `console.assert()` method is used to write an error message to the console if the assertion is false.

Example:

console.assert(2 + 2 === 5, "Error: 2 + 2 is not equal to 5");


Feel free to experiment with these console log methods in your JavaScript code!
