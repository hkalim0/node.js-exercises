# Exercise 3: Creating a Basic Express Server

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a basic Express.js server that responds with "Hello, World!" to incoming requests.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to create an Express server:

1. **Initialize your Node.js project**:
   Run the following command in your terminal to initialize your project and create a package.json file:

   npm init -y
   

2. **Install Express**:
   Run the following command in your terminal to install Express as a dependency for your project:

   npm install express
   

3. **Create your Express server**:
   Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `server.js`) and add the following code to create a basic Express server:
   
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   

4. **Start the Express server**:
   Run the following command in your terminal to start the Express server:

   npm run start
   

5. **Test your Express server**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser.

## Goals

- Install and set up Express.js for building web applications.
- Create a basic Express server that listens for incoming requests.
- Understand how to configure routes and handle HTTP requests in Express.

In this README, each step is clearly outlined with corresponding commands and explanations. Users can follow these steps to set up an Express server, install dependencies, create routes, and test the server locally. This structure helps users understand the process and easily follow along to create their own Express applications.
